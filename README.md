### Tech Stack
- [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) is used for Frontend.
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) is used in the backend. The API endpoint for getting the recommmendations is setup with cross-site-origin access.
- [Scikit Learn Count-Vectorizer](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) Scikit-Learn's CountVectorizer is used for preperation of the Recomendeer system. The Cosine similarity parameter is used for finding the closest neigbhours. The top 10 movies with closest similarity score are selected.
- [Heroku](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python) The application is deployed live on Heroku, using gunicorn static-file web server.
