### Overview
This Movie Recommendation System uses Content-Based filtering approach to determine movie recommendations based on user search. <br />
It is created using Flask web framework and is deployed on Heroku. <br />
(Preprocessed data enclosed in this github-repo as main_data.csv)

### Tech Stack
- [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) is used for Frontend.
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) is used in the backend. The API endpoint for getting the recommmendations is setup with cross-site-origin access.
- [Scikit Learn Count-Vectorizer](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) Scikit-Learn's CountVectorizer is used for preperation of the Recomendeer system. The Cosine similarity parameter is used for finding the closest neigbhours. The top 10 movies with closest similarity score are selected.
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) python package is used for web scraping the movie reviews from IMBD and to classify them, sentiment analysis is performed for which multinomial Naive Bayes classifier provides an accuracy of about 97.47%.
- [Tmdb](https://github.com/gajus/tmdb) is used to fetch the attribute information and image data of movies and recommendations accoriding to official IMDB's records.
- [Heroku](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python) The application is deployed live on Heroku, using gunicorn static-file web server.
### Install and Run on your Machine:
